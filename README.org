# .emacs.d

Laura's Emacs config. It is oriented to the use of Emacs as a LaTeX editor.

The specific packages used in a LaTeX file are:
 * [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AucTeX]] ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AUCTeX][EmacsWiki AUCTeX]]) : Basic package to work with LaTeX files.
 * [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/reftex.html][RefTeX]] : to make \label's and \ref's
 * [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][Org-ref]] (The amazing package of John Kitchin (a reference in Emacs world)) : to make \cite's and edit .bib files (in a while to make \label's and \ref's also!)
 * [[https://github.com/cdominik/cdlatex][CDLaTeX]] : A perfect complement. To improve =TAB=, math symbols insertion, LaTeX modifications (like \mathcal{S}...)...

There are also a lot of other packages, take a look at [[file:init.el][init.el]] and [[file:init.org][init.org]] (recall that the configuration for LaTeX-mode is in [[file:lisp/brusts-latex-config.org][brust-latex-config.org]]).

If you are looking for useful functions, you should take look at the following list.
 * Functions from other places (there are some references, but I forget many):
   - [[file:init.org::*Customize%20face%20at%20point][Customize face at point]]
   - [[file:init.org::#09e39cd8-2272-4405-889a-3fb24205b7c5][Copy file path to kill ring (by Xah Lee]]
   - [[file:init.org::*Double%20Capitals][Double Capitals]]
   - [[file:init.org::*Find%20file%20sudo][Find file sudo]]

   - [[file:init.org::*Mouse%20wheel][Mouse wheel]]
   - [[file:lisp/brusts-latex-config.org::*Whitespace%20cleaning][Whitespace cleaning]] (To clean up LaTeX documents)
 * Functions from other places but improved/adapted by and to me:
   - [[file:init.org::*Close<->open%20parents][Close<->open parents]]
   - [[file:init.org::*Narrow%20or%20widen%20dwin][Narrow or widen dwin]]
   - [[file:init.org::*Open%20fast%20usual%20files%20(by%20Xah%20Lee)][Open fast usual files]]

   - [[file:lisp/brusts-latex-config.org::*Select%20current%20math%20furmula][Select current math furmula]]
   - [[file:lisp/brusts-latex-config.org::*Adaptation%20to%20my%20style][Adaptation to my style]] (cdlatex is a great package, but I need some advices ;)
   - [[file:init.org::*My-dictionary][My-dictionary]] (To make you own dictionary with LaTeX, they work together with https://github.com/LauBrust/MyDictionary)
   - [[file:init.org::*Teaching%20functions][Teaching functions]] (sort of functions to write down the marks of my students).
     (Both "My-dictionary" and "Teaching functions" use the incredible [[https://github.com/abo-abo/headlong][abo-abo's headlong.el]])
