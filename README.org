# .emacs.d

Laura's Emacs config. It is oriented to the use of Emacs as a LaTeX editor.

The specific packages used in a LaTeX file are:
 * [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AucTeX]] ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AUCTeX][EmacsWiki AUCTeX]]) : Basic package to work with LaTeX files.
 * [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/reftex.html][RefTeX]] : to make \label's and \ref's
 * [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][Org-ref]] (The amazing package of John Kitchin (a reference in Emacs world)) : to make \cite's and edit .bib files (in a while to make \label's and \ref's also!)
 * [[https://github.com/cdominik/cdlatex][CDLaTeX]] : A perfect complement. To improve =TAB=, math symbols insertion, LaTeX modifications (like \mathcal{S}...)...

There are also a lot of other packages, take a look at [[file:init.el][init.el]] and [[file:init.org][init.org]].
